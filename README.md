# 440Project
final project for 440

After you read the paper and watch the video, look at the information below.

Be sure to look at the preprocessing.ipynb file first. While you cannot run it yourself, there is extensive documentation showing the result of running each cell and the output it will be. Still look at it as it clears up a lot of context concerning how we preprocess our data

Unfortunately, most of the code has a lot of setup to actually run any of it. I confirmed with Professor Fabio Abreu De Santos and he said this was fine (since it was a research project). However, I wanted the grader to be able to run something so I included an alternate way to train/test the model on CPS data. This alternate way is inside of Train/Test.ipynb. Please run it through Google Colab (watch the video and it will explain it and show proof of me running it).

There are several example files in here as well. BertCPS is an example of what a finalized BERT file will look like (before train/test). I included a verbal and prosodic file so you can see what both modalities look like. The proof of submission image is included as well. Results.zip includes the final results of all of our training data

Trainer.py is the actual training file we used for final results. This one is impossible for the grader to run since it requires advance setup (Spark among many other technologies to run). I attached it though so the grader can understand how our lab is getting these results without having to run things locally

The other Jupyter Notebook attached is for actually visualizing the data. This one cannot be run either (as it requires specific setup) but it can be looked at again to see how our lab sees our final results for this project
